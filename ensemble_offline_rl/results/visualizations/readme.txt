Visualization scripts used to obtain all figures in the thesis.

The script evaluation.py contains the evaluation loop and the code to generate
the main performance curve (taken from the original Unifloral repository).

The script eval_aggregate_plots contains code to generate all violin plots 

The respective data folders contain all the necessary data to rerun and edit
the evaluation scripts (1000 scores for each trained policy for each algorithm
and each environment).
